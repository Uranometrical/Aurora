# Aurora - The Minecraft Launcher
*Aurora* is a Minecraft launcher written in C#, built off of [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework).

I am **not** a graphic designer, nor am I good with UI. Numerous elements of the UI are adapted from [osu](https::/github.com/ppy/osu), under the MIT framework.
